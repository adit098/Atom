***Simple Social Media App:***
This is a simple clone of social apps. Users can signup, log in,
create groups, create posts in any group, delete his/her posts,
see all the posts. Any users (Whether logged in or not) can see
the created groups by the authenticated users.

***[Blog App](http://adit098.pythonanywhere.com/):***
This is a simple blog like functioning application, where
authenticated users can create, remove, update posts, and
comment on posts. I used medium-editor, bootstrap, and
pagination for a better look at the application. The user has the
option to publish a post or not. Unpublished posts get posted in
the Draft section.
